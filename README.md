# Pillager Campaigns

Pillager Campaigns is a server-side Minecraft Forge mod for Minecraft 1.20.1. It supplies frequent overland scout pressure and sparse, warned pillager assaults for Survival players.

Each player has independent eligible-time clocks: scouts arrive every 6–12 minutes with 3–6 members and withdraw after two active minutes; assaults arrive every 60–120 minutes, warn two surface minutes before arrival, then deliver three progress-gated waves of 16–24 members for one player. Nearby players within 64 blocks share one scaled encounter, capped at 48 members per wave. Groups dispatch early from deterministic virtual origins 512–768 blocks away so those windows remain arrival windows, then advance immaterially at 1.6 blocks/second for scouts or 1 block/second for assaults. This strategic leg never loads or requires distant chunks.

## Development

Java 17 and the checked-in Gradle wrapper are required.

```sh
./gradlew verifyFast
./gradlew verifyFull
./gradlew verifyWorld
./gradlew runCampaignHarnessServer
./gradlew runCampaignHarnessClient
./gradlew invasionCoreExperiment
./gradlew -q :runner:run --args='example'
./gradlew -q :runner:run --args='mvp /path/to/invasion-runtime-spec.json build/invasion-readiness'
```

`verifyFast` includes the fixed 1,024-seed policy corpus. `verifyFull` adds headless Forge GameTests, and `verifyWorld` runs those tests with the exact It Takes a Pillage and Savage & Ravage runtime dependencies.

## Interactive campaign harness

`runCampaignHarnessServer` starts an isolated localhost server on port `25566` with only Forge, KotlinForForge, Pillager Campaigns, It Takes a Pillage, Savage & Ravage, and Blueprint. Its flat Survival world is retained under the ignored `run/campaign-harness-server/` directory. The first launch follows Minecraft's normal EULA acknowledgement flow; after accepting it there, rerun the task. Start `runCampaignHarnessClient` in another shell and connect to `127.0.0.1:25566`.

The server run enables permission-four harness commands that do not register in an ordinary launch. Enter them in the dedicated-server console without a leading slash:

```text
pillager_campaigns harness spawn scout immediate <player> [intensity]
pillager_campaigns harness spawn assault immediate <player> [intensity]
pillager_campaigns harness spawn scout routed <player> [intensity]
pillager_campaigns harness spawn assault routed <player> [intensity]
pillager_campaigns harness next_wave <player>
pillager_campaigns harness protect <player>
pillager_campaigns inspect <player>
pillager_campaigns reset <player>
```

Intensity is optional and bounded to `0..5`. `immediate` selects loaded terrain in the normal 48–72-block arrival band while bypassing strategic travel; all roster, packet, spawn, single-path, targeting, and cleanup behavior remains real. `routed` expedites the virtual strategic leg but leaves production local-approach selection and validation in place. `next_wave` is accepted only after the current assault wave has fully materialized. `protect` grants a test-only invulnerability ability while retaining Survival mode, so a routed campaign can be observed without combat ending the target's soak. Use `resetCampaignHarnessWorld` when an explicitly fresh harness world is wanted.

The `mvp` runner gate proves deterministic Core properties only: per-player cadence, bounded scaling, composition, effect lifecycle, and terminal resolution under authored surface observations. It does not simulate Minecraft combat, entity AI, terrain, or player behavior.

Export the exact available roster and scalar rules from a running instance with `/pillager_campaigns export_runtime_spec`. The file is written beneath the world at `pillager_campaigns/exports/invasion-runtime-spec.json`.

## Architecture

- `invasion-core/` owns both clocks, grouping, wave budgets, roster composition, deterministic strategic traversal, caps, lifecycle, persistence shapes, and the durable effect outbox.
- `runner/` executes the exact compiled Core against synthetic observations and writes the hard readiness report.
- `src/main/kotlin/com/bettercontent/pillagercampaigns/` records genuinely loaded Minecraft terrain, executes warning/materialize/retire effects, persists the Core snapshot and terrain atlas, and maintains native mob targeting.

The atlas stores a compact surface column for chunks that normal play has loaded. After virtual travel completes, local routing considers only the 48–72-block approach band. The graph requires a solid floor, two blocks of clearance, one-block ascent, two-block descent, and never traverses unknown cells. Forge reads live terrain only with `getChunkNow`; no campaign route loads, generates, or tickets a chunk. A known wall or cliff produces an exterior defensive frontier. Exact placement uses only connected exterior columns. One real lead mob validates the selected frontier at materialization; after that, vanilla navigation owns every campaign member. Failed local searches retry every 100 ticks and retire the encounter after 2,400 eligible surface ticks so cadence cannot remain occupied indefinitely.

World saves use campaign schema 4. Schema-2 eligible clocks, cadence, sequence, and outcome adjustment migrate while active schema-2 encounters are cleared. Active schema-3 encounters retain their pressure and roster state but restart at the virtual-travel boundary because their atlas paths used the retired distant-terrain contract.

## Commands

- `/pillager_campaigns status [player]` reports cadence, encounter phase, virtual progress, and the last local-route result
- `/pillager_campaigns force [scout|assault] [player]` succeeds only when a real encounter materializes on a loaded, validated local approach; rejection leaves pressure unchanged
- `/pillager_campaigns inspect [player]` reports the live encounter, wave, targeting, provenance, virtual journey, local-route diagnostics, and roster state
- `/pillager_campaigns reset [player]`
- `/pillager_campaigns export_runtime_spec`

### Injury integration
Death’s Door players remain eligible campaign targets. Only confirmed final death triggers death retirement; low-health spacing uses semantic HP, including zero at Death’s Door.
